### Today I learned

Rubber duck debugging - it can be helpful to explain an issue to a friend or an object to solve a problem. This is how I was able to follow the terminal exercises. I wrote down my questions as if I was speaking to a fictional person. 

Today's asked how can we start pair programming today? I'm not sure yet! I guess I can ask if anyone wants to make a site for fun together. 

In html padding denotes the space around objects. 
The brains wants to read an average of 14 words per line. 

I really need to take more screenshots. I don't seem to find many websites I like very often. I also don't seem to come across novel websites as often as I used to. 

I learned a better way to link to local images. I was over thinking the file path prior and since my png file is in the same folder as my web-portal all I needed was ".gownron."

I also learned that "../" can indicate to link to the file in the parent folder. 

The rel attribute sets the relationship between your page and the linked url.  "noopener noreferrer" prevents tabnabbing. It basically prevents your link from connecting to a fake login page. 


## conclusion
I think I am starting to have a better grasp of how to get through all the PE materials. I am really appreciating this catch up day and how much easier it is to type with reading glasses on! There are a lot of small things I've missed or haven't been able to interanalize until meeting with a classmate or Derrek. I need to remember that meetings are always helpful! I found better ways to organize and link to my files today, spent some time slowly reading about html questions I had, and spent time organizing the best way to structure my learning days.
