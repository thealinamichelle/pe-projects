HTTP: It's a protocol
hypertext transfer protocol
	allows the transfer of web pages over the internet and defines how the web browder will respond to any request
	The web address of all the web pages contains a protocol, domain name, and path to the web page


	MDN:  HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

FTP: I assume this is a protocol
file transfer protocol

how do I use this in a sentence
air example?


I know http isn't as secure as https

pops imap smtp are protocol ive interacted with when setting up email forwarding


we use interact with these protocols but dont know how they function or what they do
it's a black box


both connect to a server
hypertext - I assume this relates to the cerser and translating html and css

ftp connects to a server but no cerser necessary. It's a method of placing files into another piece of software located on a machine somewhere else. We use this to share our projects. We can upload all kinds of files.

According to Geek for Geeks 
 	 It is older and is being replaced with new protocols. FTP supports two separate Transmission Control Protocols the first one is a control connection or command port (port 21 ) to authenticate the user and the second one is a data connection or data port(port 20) to transfer the files. It requires a specific username and password for access.

 We use SFTP for pe dev projects. S for secure right?
