Learning new things is hard

- this is not my first online education
- not my first visual education
-not my first foray into something cody like?

- it is the first time in years Im optimistic about learning
- first time I have woken up excited to work everyday
- I get anxious I can't finish everything in time
- I have to tell myself stop because it's so compelling.



 In the past it's been isolating, lonely and boring. 



 My husband remarked last night on yesterday's post “there’s an unmistakable voice in writing where you feel that something is an *assignment*“ but then went on to expound that it's also the first time in years he has seen me optimistic about what I am learning. Going back to class in adulthood can be hard, and online education has extra obsticles that this millenial finds really difficult to overcome. However, he's right. I am really exited to tackle the subjects I come across in PE's education. 

PE organizes it's lessons historically, so that you mentally build the concepts used in code as they were developed. I am finding this teaching method helps me to form a mental model of what I'm doing better than just reading a definiton on wikipedia or on the Mozilla Developer Network Web Docs. So, we are currently playing with code used in the 90s, and have making small project websites to test various methods for organizing web content. Yesterday, we were introduced to the <div> element. Div stands for generic divider, and it's terms like this that can form big road blocks for people learning to code. The div element functions as a box that holds other elements, and it can stack vertically. It can also be assigned a marker through an ID. So it will read <div id=header>, <div id=main> <div id=footer> When HTML 5 was released they turned these common IDs into their own elements so people can just write <header>, <main>, <footer>. However, when someone learning these concepts for the first time in 2022 it can be really confusing knowing that there are <sections>, <main>, <div> etc, all of which seem to be very similar concepts. Our inner annoying child starts asking why repeatedly and gets in the way of learning how to use these tools, or at least my inner child does. 

Why is a valid question. Knowing why something exists can be integral to understanding how it functions, and that's been the case with <div> for many of my classmates. When I trained dogs, I was always asked why does the dog do x? Conservly, in those situations it was important to often say "There's no good way to know the why. We can observe the behavior and we know this behavior is increasing or decreasing." Thus, "I don't know", is also an incredible tool. 

There is this concept of a block element vs an inline element. Somethings stack virtically like <div> and some things will line up horizontally in-line like text. Some elements have the attributes of both and it can be difficult to quantify in a nice neat list what element does what. So in these cases I'm often back to "I don't know if this is technically a block or an inline element, but I can see test how it functions by adding borders, margins and padding and seeing what happens. It feels good when different parts of my learning journey join together for a brief moment. It feels silly to write that playing around with <div> is is exciting and thrilling, but it's true. It's been such a long time, since I've felt that rare feeling of enjoying my work.
