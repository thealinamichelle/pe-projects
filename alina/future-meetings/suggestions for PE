suggestions for PE


stand up:
- messaging around standups need to change
- clearer and more friendly

support systems among students are needed and need to be encouraged. That's not stand up and that's ok. But build those off topic chats. 

manadatory meetings for future groups

- frequency can filter out potential applicants so it depends on what kind of applicant you want. 
- a mandatory meeting once a month with required information or lesson would be good
- conditions like getting kicked out are too extreme
- maybe infrequent enough so students don't learn they can miss it and be ok.
