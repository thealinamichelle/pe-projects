- is the difference between section and div semantics only?

Assignments:
Thursday: no feedback required

Friday:
https://codepen.io/thealinamichelle/pen/YzLoGBe
There is a certain point where I can't figure out what normal font looks like anymore. How far apart should words be, how tall are line heights usually, how far apart are letters? By the end of this exercise I really struggled to know if my article looked "good" or not. Good type seems like it's something you don't notice, but bad type is easy to see. I'm also struggle to know when margin-left: auto and margin-right: auto is the right tool. My article was stuck to the left forever and I'm not sure what finally allowed me to to center the whole thing. I was also super mentally fried while working on this and problem solving getting it to center was the final step.

### stand up

#### Yesterday: 
I learned more about the div element, about the in-block and block attributes. 
I signed up for CodePen and spent time playing around div, inlike and block. 
I had a meeting with Derek and learned some really cool stuff about 
	- the hover/transition time (and delay), 
	- clamp() attributes, 
	- @media queries and using 
	- em for button padding, 
	- nav is technically a grouping of inline elements 
	- and that sections and divs can have an id name
	- I wrote a substack post to which my husband kindly gave the feed back "There's an unmistakeable voice in writing where you feel that something is an *assignment*". Well ok, I'll do better next time. 😭

#### Blockers, Confusing Points

- Is there a difference between ```div class=``` vs ```div id=```?
- I just have a crazy amount of stuff to do this week. I got this!

#### Today
- Onto iframes!


### Tomorrow's Post:

####
Styling in Affinity Designer:
there is a part of me that get's frustrated that it's so complicated and part of me loves how much control I have. Also if you click the A tool twice you get the paragraph tool. If tou go to text > insert filler text, there is a built in lorem ipsum. 

Font Styling:
Even with taking notes it's hard to remember all the attributes for the fonts and easy to get lost among all the x + x elements.

I haven't built my goals page or resume. It feels so early to start that...I will probably start next week once I am not cramming everything into a single day.

### stand up

#### Yesterday: 
- [x] I explored Affinity Designer. I saw the project initially more as exploring the program rather than making a competent meta-image. I was very impressed with the designs everyone came up with! 
- [] Jake was kind enough to make a git and transmit video for me. I only watched about half of it before deciding I should prioritize getting into Affinity Designer.
- I downloaded Divvy, and set up a shortcut but found the program to be a little clunky. I’ve been using Magnet which places windows similar to the way Windows does and will probably continue to do so. However, Divvy seems is easier for smaller divisions.

#### Blockers, Confusing Points
 - I need to spend more time reading the metadata articles. I want to have a better grasp of why that code is written in that format. I am uncomfortable using OPG to generate the meta tags for me.
 - Slack keeps giving me an unread thread notification but when I click “threads”, I can’t determine what thread is considered unread.

#### Today
- Besides the goal of the lesson, I want to better integrate looking for visual inspiration into my day. I took a note from Hjalmar and decided to habit stack it as part of my PE starting/ending routine. 
- I want to take some time and make a better metadata image. 

### In Real Life Project Ideas:


- A little web dog walk choice adventure game (from the dog’s point of view)
- A little colorful web game about fear-free dog grooming
- Random Interval Timer with difficulty level (for use for ABA animal training and research)
- Invoice and receipt builder generated using google calendar events as the main data input.
- Calm simple visual web game (goal is to fall asleep)
- My Occupational Therapist friend’s logo/card/website


### highlights

- worked in gradiants in Affinity Designer
- realized I have actually collected some visual inspiration. 
- took some time for myself this afternoon since I was bordering on a emotional meltdown. I exercised, did a very long run, took a shower and made myself dinner. Those acts of self care did a lot for my emotional state and I am feeling much better.
- I worked on my FTP HTTP substack post. I'm not quite done, but I can wrap it up tomorrow. 

### questions

- [] Best practices for retrieving past stages from Git
- [] How does HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, IMAP, SMPT actually all differ?
- [] I need to know more about the meta tags to understand them. I am uncomfortable using OPG to generate the meta tags for me. I am not sure which part of my tag ultimately made my image pop up in Slack.

### standup

	####Yesterday: I spent time enjoying chrome dev tools, changing the code in Jess's site, and thinking about realizing I usually have the mindset I am writing files or code for myself rather than ensuring someone else could easily understand it and pick up where I left off. 

	####Blockers/Confusing Points:
	I am looking forward to the huddle with Jake and Drew about puting git onto the server. I don't understand how git will work with group files yet but I am looking forward to learning how it's done. 

	####Today's Goals
	I am very excited for affinity designer! I am super excited to explore this program today. 

### highlights

- Today we were exposed to infinity designer. It's a fairly intuitive little tool, but learning new tools definitely bumps up against my impatience resilience when I have a deadline. I need to work on that. 
- I crated a little dog logo and it's now the meta image for my index page.
- Current Standard sharing size is 1200 x 630 at 72dpi.
- A rule of thumb would be to make sure the artboard is double  the size that the end graphic will be displayed as. This will take into account future advancements and retina screens, unless svg.

### questions or blockers

- [] I need to know more about the meta tags to understand them. I am uncomfortable using OPG to generate the meta tags for me. I am not sure which part of my tag ultimately made my image pop up in Slack.

### Today I learned

- Today I learned how to better navigate chrome dev tools in order to explore the code of other developers.
- Lighthouse Analysis
- Facebook Debugger

- Meta Data is the data that provides information about other data. 
	- Descriptive Meta Data allows webcrawlers to display informative snippits when that content is shared. Well crafted meta data draws in more users and informs them what your website or content has to offer. 

- **Wikipedia breaks up meta data into these categories:**
>*Descriptive metadata* – the descriptive information about a resource. It is used for discovery and identification. It includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.
*Structural metadata* – metadata about containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters. It describes the types, versions, relationships, and other characteristics of digital materials.
*Administrative metadata* – the information to help manage a resource, like resource type, permissions, and when and how it was created.
*Reference metadata* – the information about the contents and quality of statistical data.
*Statistical metadata, also called process data,* may describe processes that collect, process, or produce statistical data.
*Legal metadata* – provides information about the creator, copyright holder, and public licensing, if provided.

### Highlights

- Web crawlers are applications that download webpages to record their content and how they are connected
- HTTPS stands for hypertext transfer protocol, is more secure than HTTP, and the current standard protocol.
- Chrome DevTools: cmd+option+i 


### questions

- [ ] Best practices for retrieving past stages from Git
- [ ] How does HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, IMAP, SMPT actually all differ?

## conclusion

- Well crafted Meta Data is extremely important to ensure your content has reach. It is often a user's first impression and will determine if they click on. It also determines whether your site is determined to be safe, can access the required character set and other important pieces of information.

### Today's Goals

- [x] Meet with Derek
- [x] Write Up a Daily Checklist
- [x] Read about noopener noreferrer links
- [x] Commit Project files in Git
- [x] Link project in PE Server Site
- [x] Rename Home

### Today I learned

Rubber duck debugging - it can be helpful to explain an issue to a friend or an object to solve a problem. This is how I was able to follow the terminal exercises. I wrote down my questions as if I was speaking to a fictional person. 

Today's asked how can we start pair programming today? I'm not sure yet! I guess I can ask if anyone wants to make a site for fun together. 

In html padding denotes the space around objects. 
The brains wants to read an average of 14 words per line. 

I really need to take more screenshots. I don't seem to find many websites I like very often. I also don't seem to come across novel websites as often as I used to. 

I learned a better way to link to local images. I was over thinking the file path prior and since my png file is in the same folder as my web-portal all I needed was ".gownron."

I also learned that "../" can indicate to link to the file in the parent folder. 

The rel attribute sets the relationship between your page and the linked url.  "noopener noreferrer" prevents tabnabbing. It basically prevents your link from connecting to a fake login page. 


## conclusion
I think I am starting to have a better grasp of how to get through all the PE materials. I am really appreciating this catch up day and how much easier it is to type with reading glasses on! There are a lot of small things I've missed or haven't been able to interanalize until meeting with a classmate or Derrek. I need to remember that meetings are always helpful! I found better ways to organize and link to my files today, spent some time slowly reading about html questions I had, and spent time organizing the best way to structure my learning days.
