# My learning journal
### This is my learning journal for personal use. It keeps track of my daily goals, notes any unique learning concepts, and any questions I come up with, first drafts for blog content, or brief exercises for PE prompts. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
##1/2/22

## Notes: 
***

### NORMAL ARRAYS

	$thing = [1, true, "dog", "cat"];
    
 - With normal arrays we can find associations by installing a [number] next to the variable like so: `$newidea[2]`


### ASSOCIATIVE ARRAYS

 - one set of brackets determines an array. Arrays that build key associations are called associative arrays. The "=>" shows a key value pairs/	
 
	$object = [ 
      "id" => " term", 
      "key" => "value?" ,
      "example" => numbers,
      "second_example" => true,
      "third_example" => 120,
      "another_array_within_an_array" => ["another" , "don't forget the commas"],]
 	
- For an Associative arrays we can select an value by the value key. `$object["key"];`
- In HTML it will look like:
		
		<p> My favorite thing is <?=$object["key"]?>.</p>


### Color Systems:
- CMYK - printing, cyan magenta yellow black
- LAB colors
- Greyscale - no hues
- RGB

		.thing {
        color: red;
        color: rgb(255, 10, 50); /*these are hard to guess!*/
        color: rgba(255, 10, 50, .5); /*adds transparency*/
        }

#### HSL 
- Three values: WHEEL/ saturation / value
- Example:
		body {
		 	background:hsl(0, 50%, 100%);
		 }
- First value, where is the hue located on the wheel?
	- first number is 0-360
	- The pattern is circular. 0 is red and so is 360
	- Think of a clock: 
		- 12 red (0/360)
		- 2 yellow (60)
		- 4 green (120)
		- 6 cyan (180)
		- 8 blue (240)
		- 10 magenta (300)

- Second value is saturation 
	- between 0 (grey) to 100% (full saturation)

- Third number is value
	- range is 0 - 100%
	- 0% is black (clue no light)
	- 100% is white (all light)
	- 50% is pure hue

- [] check in on github

#### Array Review Notes: "<p> // the right side operators will happen first. So the total on the right are parsed by the parser first? Why is is the right side first?</p>
	- Derrick says to think of it as how javascrip works:
		- Doing stuff to get it ready 
		- Creates the reference 
	- then pointing the reference to the new value.
	- that's how it works in Javascript, even if that's not how it works in PHP
	- Why isn't a semicolon required after the curly brackets?

#### Notes for standup tomorrow:
- worked on assessability issues with live captions and playback speed.
-- Substital allows to increase speed for vimeo playback
-- Mac built in live captioning allows you to change the window size and text size, so I can have one line of text and a large font. It's much easier to read and way less distracting this way.
- Worked on reviewing PHP lesson on array because I am confused on a few issues since I skipped this video. 
	--- questions: Why isn't a semicolon required after the curly brackets?"
- Installed php syntax checker
- found that I did not actually have php installed due to the error: "/bn/sh: php: command not found"
- discovered I did not have php installed? and did not have developer tools installed
- So I installed developer tools with homebrew
- installed php

#### icon game plan:
- Goals: 
 - what should the user think and feel?
 - what asthetic language tools will achieve that?
	
- Timeline:
	- hours:
		[x] .5: research each image set
		[x]	(break to walk Lobita)
		[x]	1: define common visual themes and make quick sketches by hand
		[x]	2: craft first two icons and establish visual language/style
		[x]	2.5 reuse similar shapes
		[x]	3: finish

#### yesterday's highlights: 
- After thinking about it, realized how important it is to have a cohesive design goal or “words” at the start of the project. My fine art classes really drilled into us to develop the concepts through the process of painting. However, with design that definitely slows you down and can make for a discordant design.
- There are a lot of cool affinity designer brushes for purchase.

#### one hightlight in the last lesson: 
 - I explored the lowercase a as a tool to format layouts and incididentally formed some cool logo options for myself.

 #### today's goals: 
 - catch up on all text messages!
 - finish yesterdays lesson and todays lesson
 - finish blog post draft and ask emily to take a look
 - get a large bag for andre's gift


#### today's highlights: 
 - Flush left is safe
 - Use one typeface until you know it well
 - Skip a weight so use bold and light, go for greater contrasts
 - double point sizes generally between different elements types
 - align to one axis: 
 	- Vertical: align to left of type
 	- Horizontal: strongest horizontal element
 - Use any typeface you like as long as it’s one of the following:
		Akzidenz Grotesk, Avenir, Avant Garde, Baskerville,
		Bembo, Bodoni, Bookman, Caslon, Century, Clarendon,
		Courier, DIN, Franklin Gothic, Frutiger, Futura,
		Garamond, Gill Sans, Gotham, Helvetica, Letter Gothic,
		Memphis, Meta, Mrs. Eaves, OCRB, Rockwell, Sabon,
		Times New Roman, Trade Gothic, Trajan and Univers.
- Group relared blocks of information to help visually organize information
- Avoid corners unless intentional
- Spacing matters. The closer things are together, the more the reader will
assume a relationship exists between separate blocks of information. 
- Avoid rags with shapes. The shape will be stronger than the information.
- No orphan words at the end of paragraphs.
- Be bold or italic,never regular
- Relax, It’s Just Type

#### one thing I learned yesterday: 
 - when you request a php file with <?php include("filename.php")? it tells the server to run the program (index.html for example). The server will compile all the php requests into html files and serve that back to the browser.

## prep for consolidation meeting notes:

### Reflections:

##### Which little mini projects have resonated with you and you like to flesh out a bit more?? 
 - the responsive website as a humorous burn out resource
 - svg cat
 - mock client but a different subject

##### Which areas are you feeling most attracted to? 
 - svgs right now 
 - I'd really like to go back and make a choose your own adventure. 
 

#### Known weak points:
- writing blog posts
- anything networking
- flex concepts:
	- flex-basis
	- flex-wrap
	- flex-grow 
- time allocation - hyperfocus vs distracted 
- planning out projects accurately
- github
	- how to ensure it's up to date

#### Goals
- I would love to turn an "html adventure" into a narrative svg mini-game. 
- Creae a website with my friends occupational therapy business

#### one thing I learned yesterday: 
 - Image children will break a div if the div has a max-height set. 
 - Use rubberducking before asking questions in stoackoverflow

#### Highlights: 
 - <?php include ('filename.php') ?> allows for breaking up html code into seperate files for webpages. It also makes parts of pages that are ubiquitus throughout a website be editedable from one location. This code needs to be placed in the correct location within the document flow.
 - /*  * / and // both allow for comments within php.

#### one thing I learned yesterday: 
	“&nbsp;” will add a non breakable space in the html. It worked well for my title but according to Derrick, "it can come back to haunt you later."

#### 30 minutes blog draft	
Back in september we were introduced to svgs. Wait hold on, SEPTEMBER?! It's been that long? The months are flying by. I feel like I am still at the begining of all this, how it's already almost December? Ok, back to the subject at hand, SVGs. SVG stands for scalable vector graphics, or basically graphics that can infinitely scale in size. Back in college, all my courses referred to these types of files as vector graphics, so only the extention and our current use-case were new to me. Vector or SVG graphics are made of numbers typically using points and paths. The paths are tethers between the points, so drag the points to new places and the whole line or shape changes. Because this kind of graphic is calculated numerically this way, no information is lost as the graphic is scaled upwards in size. Bitmap images (think photos from your phone) only have so much data they can work with, if you scale up the image, the software has to make it up and depending on how that's done it often distorts the image. 

For webdesign the numberical calculation of svgs is really handy, since you can pop it into the code of the page, edit that code so the the user can interact with the image or add extra flair to the page. It also makes the website load much faster since the amount of data is far smaller than a typical png or jpg. While, I know that's why the usecase is important, the previous point is what intrigues me. The abiliity to make a doodle wiggle, change color, move and become an animation is very compelling. Ages ago, I was an animation major for a hot second, but my undiagnosed ADHD got in the way and I switched paths. During the SVG lessons, I found myself obsessed with all the posibilities of how I could make a drawing move, change in size, rotate, etc. Suddenly, I was an animation student again, but I was actually enjoying it. The partnertship of drawing then writing a little string of text was delightful, rather than drawing out each individual frame. It allows for freedom of quick discovery, or for an unoptimized line of code to suprise you with it's results. The point of the lesson wasn't animation, so I larely ended up in a distraction of a rabbit hole.

Creating SVGs in affinity designer and editing their code has been my favorite thing by far so far. 

After you create your vector in Affinity designer, export your file as an svg. Then you can open that file in a text editor like sublime. Remove the docutype, version, xmls:space, xmls:xlink, and xmlns:serif as they are not necissicary. The styles can be removed and transfered to your css file. ID tags can be changed to classes for styling, since we are encouraged to style only with classes. The G tag is an svg version of a div, and the g transform is where the path is on the x/y axis. I'm sure that can also be transfered to css, but I'm not quite comfortable with that yet. Rect is a rectangle.

I have had a few issues with how I create my vectors where I end up needing to reopen the svg file I have edited, and remove a bunch of hidden groupings. That way the code is much simpler than I was getting with my initial creations. 

Have you had the chance to play around with SVGs? Do you prefer to use them or just sticking with bitmap (png/jpg) images? Why or why not?

Friday:
https://codepen.io/thealinamichelle/pen/YzLoGBe
There is a certain point where I can't figure out what normal font looks like anymore. How far apart should words be, how tall are line heights usually, how far apart are letters? By the end of this exercise I really struggled to know if my article looked "good" or not. Good type seems like it's something you don't notice, but bad type is easy to see. I'm also struggle to know when margin-left: auto and margin-right: auto is the right tool. My article was stuck to the left forever and I'm not sure what finally allowed me to to center the whole thing. I was also super mentally fried while working on this and problem solving getting it to center was the final step.

### stand up

#### Yesterday: 
I learned more about the div element, about the in-block and block attributes. 
I signed up for CodePen and spent time playing around div, inlike and block. 
I had a meeting with Derek and learned some really cool stuff about 
	- the hover/transition time (and delay), 
	- clamp() attributes, 
	- @media queries and using 
	- em for button padding, 
	- nav is technically a grouping of inline elements 
	- and that sections and divs can have an id name
	- I wrote a substack post to which my husband kindly gave the feed back "There's an unmistakeable voice in writing where you feel that something is an *assignment*". Well ok, I'll do better next time. 😭

#### Blockers, Confusing Points

- Is there a difference between ```div class=``` vs ```div id=```?
- I just have a crazy amount of stuff to do this week. I got this!

#### Today
- Onto iframes!


### Tomorrow's Post:

####
Styling in Affinity Designer:
there is a part of me that get's frustrated that it's so complicated and part of me loves how much control I have. Also if you click the A tool twice you get the paragraph tool. If tou go to text > insert filler text, there is a built in lorem ipsum. 

Font Styling:
Even with taking notes it's hard to remember all the attributes for the fonts and easy to get lost among all the x + x elements. 
https://codepen.io/thealinamichelle/pen/VwxOxEX?editors=0100

I haven't built my goals page or resume. It feels so early to start that...I will probably start next week once I am not cramming everything into a single day.

### stand up

#### Yesterday: 
- [x] I explored Affinity Designer. I saw the project initially more as exploring the program rather than making a competent meta-image. I was very impressed with the designs everyone came up with! 
- [] Jake was kind enough to make a git and transmit video for me. I only watched about half of it before deciding I should prioritize getting into Affinity Designer.
- I downloaded Divvy, and set up a shortcut but found the program to be a little clunky. I’ve been using Magnet which places windows similar to the way Windows does and will probably continue to do so. However, Divvy seems is easier for smaller divisions.

#### Blockers, Confusing Points
 - I need to spend more time reading the metadata articles. I want to have a better grasp of why that code is written in that format. I am uncomfortable using OPG to generate the meta tags for me.
 - Slack keeps giving me an unread thread notification but when I click “threads”, I can’t determine what thread is considered unread.

#### Today
- Besides the goal of the lesson, I want to better integrate looking for visual inspiration into my day. I took a note from Hjalmar and decided to habit stack it as part of my PE starting/ending routine. 
- I want to take some time and make a better metadata image. 

### In Real Life Project Ideas:


- A little web dog walk choice adventure game (from the dog’s point of view)
- A little colorful web game about fear-free dog grooming
- Random Interval Timer with difficulty level (for use for ABA animal training and research)
- Invoice and receipt builder generated using google calendar events as the main data input.
- Calm simple visual web game (goal is to fall asleep)
- My Occupational Therapist friend’s logo/card/website


### highlights

- worked in gradiants in Affinity Designer
- realized I have actually collected some visual inspiration. 
- took some time for myself this afternoon since I was bordering on a emotional meltdown. I exercised, did a very long run, took a shower and made myself dinner. Those acts of self care did a lot for my emotional state and I am feeling much better.
- I worked on my FTP HTTP substack post. I'm not quite done, but I can wrap it up tomorrow. 

### questions

- [] Best practices for retrieving past stages from Git
- [] How does HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, IMAP, SMPT actually all differ?
- [] I need to know more about the meta tags to understand them. I am uncomfortable using OPG to generate the meta tags for me. I am not sure which part of my tag ultimately made my image pop up in Slack.

### standup

	####Yesterday: I spent time enjoying chrome dev tools, changing the code in Jess's site, and thinking about realizing I usually have the mindset I am writing files or code for myself rather than ensuring someone else could easily understand it and pick up where I left off. 

	####Blockers/Confusing Points:
	I am looking forward to the huddle with Jake and Drew about puting git onto the server. I don't understand how git will work with group files yet but I am looking forward to learning how it's done. 

	####Today's Goals
	I am very excited for affinity designer! I am super excited to explore this program today. 

### highlights

- Today we were exposed to infinity designer. It's a fairly intuitive little tool, but learning new tools definitely bumps up against my impatience resilience when I have a deadline. I need to work on that. 
- I crated a little dog logo and it's now the meta image for my index page.
- Current Standard sharing size is 1200 x 630 at 72dpi.
- A rule of thumb would be to make sure the artboard is double  the size that the end graphic will be displayed as. This will take into account future advancements and retina screens, unless svg.

### questions or blockers

- [] I need to know more about the meta tags to understand them. I am uncomfortable using OPG to generate the meta tags for me. I am not sure which part of my tag ultimately made my image pop up in Slack.

- Today I learned how to better navigate chrome dev tools in order to explore the code of other developers.
- Lighthouse Analysis
- Facebook Debugger

- Meta Data is the data that provides information about other data. 
	- Descriptive Meta Data allows webcrawlers to display informative snippits when that content is shared. Well crafted meta data draws in more users and informs them what your website or content has to offer. 

- **Wikipedia breaks up meta data into these categories:**
>*Descriptive metadata* – the descriptive information about a resource. It is used for discovery and identification. It includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.
*Structural metadata* – metadata about containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters. It describes the types, versions, relationships, and other characteristics of digital materials.
*Administrative metadata* – the information to help manage a resource, like resource type, permissions, and when and how it was created.
*Reference metadata* – the information about the contents and quality of statistical data.
*Statistical metadata, also called process data,* may describe processes that collect, process, or produce statistical data.
*Legal metadata* – provides information about the creator, copyright holder, and public licensing, if provided.

### Highlights

- Web crawlers are applications that download webpages to record their content and how they are connected
- HTTPS stands for hypertext transfer protocol, is more secure than HTTP, and the current standard protocol.
- Chrome DevTools: cmd+option+i 


### questions

- [ ] Best practices for retrieving past stages from Git

### questions

- [ ] How to git commit files in the PE server?

### Today I learned

Rubber duck debugging - it can be helpful to explain an issue to a friend or an object to solve a problem. This is how I was able to follow the terminal exercises. I wrote down my questions as if I was speaking to a fictional person. 

Today's asked how can we start pair programming today? I'm not sure yet! I guess I can ask if anyone wants to make a site for fun together. 

In html padding denotes the space around objects. 
The brains wants to read an average of 14 words per line. 

I really need to take more screenshots. I don't seem to find many websites I like very often. I also don't seem to come across novel websites as often as I used to. 

I learned a better way to link to local images. I was over thinking the file path prior and since my png file is in the same folder as my web-portal all I needed was ".gownron."

I also learned that "../" can indicate to link to the file in the parent folder. 

The rel attribute sets the relationship between your page and the linked url.  "noopener noreferrer" prevents tabnabbing. It basically prevents your link from connecting to a fake login page. 


## conclusion
I think I am starting to have a better grasp of how to get through all the PE materials. I am really appreciating this catch up day and how much easier it is to type with reading glasses on! There are a lot of small things I've missed or haven't been able to interanalize until meeting with a classmate or Derrek. I need to remember that meetings are always helpful! I found better ways to organize and link to my files today, spent some time slowly reading about html questions I had, and spent time organizing the best way to structure my learning days.
