# My learning journal
This is my learning journal for personal use. It keeps track of my daily goals, notes any unique learning concepts, and any questions I come up with.

- Lighthouse Analysis
- Facebook Debugger

- Meta Data is the data that provides information about other data. 
	- Descriptive Meta Data allows webcrawlers to display informative snippits when that content is shared. Well crafted meta data draws in more users and informs them what your website or content has to offer. 

- **Wikipedia breaks up meta data into these categories:**
>*Descriptive metadata* – the descriptive information about a resource. It is used for discovery and identification. It includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.
*Structural metadata* – metadata about containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters. It describes the types, versions, relationships, and other characteristics of digital materials.
*Administrative metadata* – the information to help manage a resource, like resource type, permissions, and when and how it was created.
*Reference metadata* – the information about the contents and quality of statistical data.
*Statistical metadata, also called process data,* may describe processes that collect, process, or produce statistical data.
*Legal metadata* – provides information about the creator, copyright holder, and public licensing, if provided.

### Highlights

- Web crawlers are applications that download webpages to record their content and how they are connected
- HTTPS stands for hypertext transfer protocol, is more secure than HTTP, and the current standard protocol.
- Chrome DevTools: cmd+option+i 


### questions

- [ ] Best practices for retrieving past stages from Git
- [ ] How does HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, IMAP, SMPT actually all differ?

## conclusion

- Well crafted Meta Data is extremely important to ensure your content has reach. It is often a user's first impression and will determine if they click on. It also determines whether your site is determined to be safe, can access the required character set and other important pieces of information.

### Today I learned

Rubber duck debugging - it can be helpful to explain an issue to a friend or an object to solve a problem. This is how I was able to follow the terminal exercises. I wrote down my questions as if I was speaking to a fictional person. 

Today's asked how can we start pair programming today? I'm not sure yet! I guess I can ask if anyone wants to make a site for fun together. 

In html padding denotes the space around objects. 
The brains wants to read an average of 14 words per line. 

I really need to take more screenshots. I don't seem to find many websites I like very often. I also don't seem to come across novel websites as often as I used to. 

I learned a better way to link to local images. I was over thinking the file path prior and since my png file is in the same folder as my web-portal all I needed was ".gownron."

I also learned that "../" can indicate to link to the file in the parent folder. 

The rel attribute sets the relationship between your page and the linked url.  "noopener noreferrer" prevents tabnabbing. It basically prevents your link from connecting to a fake login page. 


## conclusion
I think I am starting to have a better grasp of how to get through all the PE materials. I am really appreciating this catch up day and how much easier it is to type with reading glasses on! There are a lot of small things I've missed or haven't been able to interanalize until meeting with a classmate or Derrek. I need to remember that meetings are always helpful! I found better ways to organize and link to my files today, spent some time slowly reading about html questions I had, and spent time organizing the best way to structure my learning days.
